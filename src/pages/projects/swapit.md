## "Create, post and exchange with other people"

## About the project

Swap it is a social platform designed to post and exchange handmade products between people, using photographies, drawings, decoration items, etc., as currency.

## Challenge and Technologies

The platform consists of a responsive MERN stack web application made to put into practice acquired knowledge such as React Hooks, implementing libraries such as Bootstrap, socket.io and UI material components for the frontend. We have used NodeJS and Express to manage the server side using Cloudinary for image storage and management and MongoDB for storing user data. Deployed with heroku.
